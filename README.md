Simple app with text-based UI that helps to track your climbers ascents and training progress. Written in Python as one of the first projects on a back-end developer bootcamp that I took in may/june 2017.

The app is based on a database I designed (find it here: https://github.com/RafalSl/wykaz_przejsc) that offers many ways to store climbers training data and to monitor one's climbing progress. This application however implements only some basic functions (connecting to the database, ascents' and routes' list, adding new ascents and new routes) as I'm going to write fully functional application in Java - Spring framework.

All commands and messages in the app are written in Polish, but the code and comments in it are in English.
There are some when trying to add a route or ascent with Polish letters.
